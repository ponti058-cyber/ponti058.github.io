           <h2>Why UMD?</h2>

               <div class="text-content">
                   <p>For me, the decision to go to UMD was all due to the location and proximity to nature. Various forests and hiking trails are close to campus, offering a peaceful getaway from the demands of schoolwork and everyday stress. Likewise, Lake Superior acts as the perfect backdrop for reflection, recreation, and relaxation—whether it’s watching the sunrise over the water, walking along the shore, or simply enjoying the calming presence of the lake. The natural beauty surrounding UMD creates a unique atmosphere that supports both academic focus and personal well-being.</p>
