                  <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
                  <p>My name is Emily Pontinen, and I grew up on the Iron Range in Minnesota. After graduating from both high school and community college at the same time through PSEO, I found myself unsure of what I wanted to do with my life—and feeling like I had very little time to figure it out. After some careful thought, I decided to take a gap year, and I can honestly say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I had the opportunity to travel to several new countries, experience a variety of cultures, and gain insights I could never have found in a classroom.
                   This year, I chose to continue my education at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where I’m studying Finance with the goal of eventually earning a master’s degree in International Business.</p>
